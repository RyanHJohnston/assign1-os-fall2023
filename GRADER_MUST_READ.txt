I'm not sure how you're going to test this project, but here are the MAKE commands to help you out.

# Builds all object files
make all

# Removes all executables
make clean

# Builds only wordcount.o
make wordcount

# Builds only multiple_wordcount.o
make multiple_wordcount

# Runs all executables with input_txt files on both multiple and single wordcount files
make run

# Same thing as 'make run' except it runs with valgrind
make valgrind_run

# Runs only wordcount executable with input test files
make run_wordcount

# Runs only multiple_wordcount executable with input test files
make run_multiple_wordcount

# The rest are commands that run the executables with valgrind
make valgrind_run_wordcount
make valgrind_run_multiple_wordcount
