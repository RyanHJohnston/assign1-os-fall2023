1. I did not collaborate with anyone on this project, I did it entirely on my own.

2. Yes, I believe everything I did was correct.

3. As far as I can tell, everything works just fine.

4. There wasn't anything that I found too challenging, it was a good assignment. It wasn't as
difficult as I thought it was going to be. It ended up being fun to work on. There isn't anything
that I believe could improve the project.
